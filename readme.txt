== Installation ==
= Installation =
1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Configure the plugin via **Settings > jQuery Responsive Select Menu**.

= Settings =
**Menu Container(s) Class / ID**  
For each menu you wish to make responsive, enter the class or ID of an element containing that menu's &lt;ul&gt; element. For example, say you have the following HTML markup:

	<nav class="nav-primary">
		<div class="wrap">
			<ul class="menu">
				<li><a>Menu Item 1</a></li>
				<li><a>Menu Item 2</a></li>
				<li><a>Menu Item 3</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</nav>

You could enter `.nav-primary` or even `.nav-primary .wrap` for the Menu Container(s) Class / ID setting. If you have multiple menus you'd like make responsive, simply enter a comma-separated list.

Note: you may need to use a tool like Chrome inspect or Firebug to determine the appropriate class / ID for your menus.

**Maximum Menu Width**  
The width at which you want your normal menu to switch to the responsive, drop-down select menu.

**Sub Item Spacer**  
The character used to denote sub-items in your drop-down select menus.

**First Term**  
The text for the select menu's top-level "dummy" item. If left blank, the drop-down select's item will be the first item in your normal navigation menu.

**Show Current Page**  
If checked, your drop-down select menu will show the current page. If unchecked, the menu will display the top-level "dummy" item.

**Omit Placeholder Items**  
If checked, the generated drop-down menu won't include any menu items whose `href` attribute is empty or "#".
